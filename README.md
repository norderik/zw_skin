ZW Skin
=======

A modified core skin for TYPO3 CMS 7.6.

It contains the following changes:
* more compact main menu (reduced spacing between menu buttons to reduce height) 
* reduced contrast - instead of the black menu background a lighter grey is chosen while retaining the distinction of the hover and active menu items
* installed extensions in the extension manager have a green icon to make the extension state more distinct
